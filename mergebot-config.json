CI tests can only run with a Mesosphere employee's approval, and before tests are triggered it might look like your tests have failed. Please contact a repo maintainer and ask them to trigger your tests. If you don't know who to reach out to, please ping the community team either via [email](community@dcos.io) or message @joerg.mesosphere in [DC/OS community slack](chat.dcos.io). We are actively working on improving this contribution experience, so stay tuned. Thanks again for your contribution!"
