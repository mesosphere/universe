  "preInstallNotes": "This DC/OS Service is currently EXPERIMENTAL. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\n```Advanced Installation options```\n\nstorage / *persistence*: create local persistent volumes for internal storage files to survive across restarts or failures.\n\nstorage / *host_volume*:  if persistence is not selected, this package can use a local volume in the host for storage, like a local directory or an NFS mount. The parameter *host_volume* controls the path in the host in which these volumes will be created, which MUST be the same on all nodes of the cluster.\n\nNOTE: If you didn't select persistence in the storage section, or provided a valid value for *host_volume* on installation,\nYOUR DATA WILL NOT BE SAVED IN ANY WAY.\n\nnetworking / *port*: This DC/OS service can be accessed from any other application through a NAMED VIP in the format *`service_name.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:port`*. Check status of the VIP in the *Network* tab of the DC/OS Dashboard (Enterprise DC/OS only).\n\nnetworking / *external_access*: create an entry in Marathon-LB for accessing the service from outside of the cluster\n\nnetworking / *external_access_port*: port to be used in Marathon-LB for accessing the service.\n\nnetworking / *external_ui_access*: create an entry in Marathon-LB for accessing the status UI web page",
