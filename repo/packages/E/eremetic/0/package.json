  "description": "Eremetic is a Mesos Framework to run one-shot tasks. The vision is to provide a bridge between Applications that need to run tasks and Mesos. That way a developer creating an application that needs to launch tasks into a cluster wouldn't need to manage Mesos resource offers directly.\n\nNew User Tutorial: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/eremetic",
