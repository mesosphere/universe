There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\nThis package will automatically connect to an existing DC/OS `postgresql` package through an automated Virtual IP.\n\nThis package is accessible through the DC/OS `Services` tab. If the `external_access`is enabled on installation, it will also create an entry in the DC/OS external load balancer for accessing the UI from outside the cluster, by default in port `15433`.
