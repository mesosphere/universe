  "description": "Grafana is a leading open source application for visualizing large-scale measurement data. It provides a powerful and elegant way to create, share, and explore data and dashboards from your disparate metric databases, either with your team or the world. Grafana is most commonly used for Internet infrastructure and application analytics, but many use it in other domains including industrial sensors, home automation, weather, and process control. Grafana features pluggable panels and data sources allowing easy extensibility. There is currently rich support for Graphite, InfluxDB and OpenTSDB. There is also experimental support for KairosDB, and SQL is on the roadmap. Grafana has a variety of panels, including a fully featured graph panel with rich visualization options.\n\nThis package can be used alongside the DC/OS 'cadvisor' and 'grafana' packages for a cluster-wide monitoring solution.\n\nInstallation Documentation: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/1.8/cadvisor-influxdb-grafana\n\n",
