  "preInstallNotes": "This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. We recommend a minimum of three nodes with at least 4 CPU and 6GB of RAM available for the Scale services and running Scale jobs. By default, Elasticsearch package *must* be running within your DCOS cluster. If you wish to use an externally hosted Elasticsearch cluster, specify one or more of the nodes in comma delimited format in the SCALE_ELASTICSEARCH_URLS variable. For quick-start purposes, Scale is bootstrapped with a Postgres database. This should *NEVER* be used for production purposes as it offers no underlying storage persistence. It can be replaced with an externally hosted Postgres by setting DB_HOST and associated settings appropriately. If you are running DCOS 1.8 Enterprise Edition or higher, you will need to set the DCOS_OAUTH_TOKEN in the DCOS section of the Advanced Settings. This value can be found within the dcos.toml file under in the dcos_acs_token value on a system with an authenticated DCOS CLI.\n\nTutorial documentation for Scale can be found here: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/scale",
