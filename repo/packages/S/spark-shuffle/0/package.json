  "description": "During large shuffles Spark creates a bunch of temporary shuffle blocks to local directory configured by the spark.local.dir property. When the executor stops, an external shuffle service can keep track of these files locations and makes sure that they are not removed while the driver is still alive, so that they can be retrieved later by other executors.\n\nThis package provides that mapping and shuffling service seamlessly across a DC/OS cluster.\n\nInstallation Documentation: https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/1.8/spark-shuffle",
