Sysdig Cloud comes with built-in, first class support for Mesos, Marathon, and DC/OS.\nThis package will automatically deploy the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each Mesos Agent (aka Slave) node in your cluster. Note, for maximum functionality, including full metadata support, you'll still want to manually install the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each of your Mesos Master nodes as well.",

    "preInstallNotes": "To complete the install, you'll need to provide your Sysdig Cloud Access Key, which can be found here: https://app.sysdigcloud.com/#/settings/user.\nYou'll also need to indicate the number of Sysdig Cloud agent containers to deploy. Marathon will automatically ensure that only one agent container is installed per node - so best practice is to provide a number that is greater than the total number of nodes in your cluster. This will ensure that as your cluster expands, new nodes will be automatically instrumented and monitored.",
