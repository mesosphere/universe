Sysdig Cloud comes with built-in, first class support for Mesos, Marathon, and DC/OS.\n\nThis package will automatically deploy the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each Mesos Agent (aka Slave) node in your cluster. Note, for maximum functionality, including full metadata support, you'll still need to manually install the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each of your Mesos Master nodes as well.
