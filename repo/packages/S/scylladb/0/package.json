  "preInstallNotes": "This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\n*Storage* - By default this package uses mounted volumes for the host as storage. Please configure the path if it anything other than /mnt/scylla. Remember that if no storage alternative is chosen, no data will be persisted outside of the container. We strongly recommend using mounted XFS host disks over local persistent storage.\n\n*Security* - Scylla supports both node-to-node and client TLS as well as User/Password authentication and table authorization. To generate keys for Scylla to use, follow this guide: http://docs.scylladb.com/tls-ssl/. If you use PasswordAuthentication Scylla automatically replicates the `system_auth` keyspace to all nodes on startup according to: http://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/authentication/. It also per default use authorization, which means you need to explicitly give access to new users.Remember that the default user is `cassandra` with password `cassandra`. These are needed when connecting to the database: `cqlsh ip-of-a-node -u cassandra -p cassandra`.",
