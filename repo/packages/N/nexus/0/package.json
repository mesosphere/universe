Having Marathon-lb installed and setting a virtual host in the config is required for being able to access Nexus. If you're using a host volume, make sure that the folder exists on the host you used for host pinning, and that you did a 'chown -R 200:200' on the folder. Default credentials are admin/admin123. Please change them after the first login.",
