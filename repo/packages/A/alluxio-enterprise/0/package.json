  "description": "Alluxio Enterprise Edition (AEE). Please obtain a license by visiting: https://alluxio.com/products \n\n Alluxio, formerly Tachyon, is the world's first system that unifies disparate storage systems at memory speed. With Alluxio, enterprises can manage data efficiently, accelerate business analytics, and ease the adoption of hybrid cloud. \n\n Please refer to https://alluxio.com/docs/ for a detailed operation guide. \n\n Release Notes: \n We are excited to announce the release of Alluxio Enterprise Edition v1.4. This release includes several major improvements. Highlights for the release are listed below.
\n Fast Durable Writes
- Enterprise-grade implementation of asynchronous persistence, which makes it possible to write data at memory-speed and have Alluxio automatically persist the data in the background.
- Optionally, the application can specify the initial replication factor for the data and Alluxio will guarantee that the data is replicated across Alluxio workers before completing the write operation. This functionality makes it possible to provide network-speed durability.
\n Capability-based Data Authorization
- This feature strengthens the security guarantees provided by Alluxio, preventing attackers from being able to bypass authorization by communicating directly with Alluxio workers.
\n Optimized Integrations with Object Storage
- 10x speed up for file creation
- 4x speed up for file deletion
- Improved algorithm for discovering files in the under storage, resulting in 4x performance improvement
- Streamlined programming interface, reducing the lines of code required for a new integration by half
\n More Flexible S3A Connector
- Enables connecting to other storage systems implementing S3-like interfaces, such as Minio
- Support for Apache Hive
- Integration for running Apache Hive on top of Alluxio, see the documentation for more details
\n Improved integration with YARN based applications
- Support for user and permissions when running YARN applications which interact with Alluxio
\n Native REST File System API
- Interact with Alluxio with the native File System API through a RESTful interface
\n Configurable Behavior for File TTL
- Allows for user defined behavior on TTL expiry, defaulting to deletion but can be configured to free the file from Alluxio instead
\n Alluxio - UFS Consistency Check
- A new shell command which provides a simple way for administrators to validate the consistency of their Alluxio metadata with the underlying storage system
- An automatic check runs on Alluxio start up to validate the consistency of all persisted files with the mounted under storages
\n Improved Lock Management in Alluxio Master
- Allows higher concurrency for common metadata operation patterns in MapReduce based frameworks
- Can provide order of magnitude performance improvements when using under storages with slow file system metadata operations (such as renames in cloud stores)
