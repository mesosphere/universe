There may be bugs, incomplete\nfeatures, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\nIf you didn't provide a value for `host_volume` when installing the package,\nYOUR DATA WILL NOT BE SAVED IN ANY WAY.\n\nThis DC/OS OpenLDAP package creates a named Virtual IP for other services in the cluster to access the service in the format `openldap.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:389` (where `openldap` would be the package name used for installation). It also creates an entry in the External Load Balancer for accessing the service from outside of the cluster on port `10389`.\n\n You can administer this service easily installing the DC/OS `openldap-admin` package.",
